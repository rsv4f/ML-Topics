## Bayes Classifier 

Implement the naive Bayes classifier (NBC) and logistic regression with gradient descent algorithms to solve a binary classification problem for a dataset of your choosing with continuous input and binary output. Use all built-in functions. The built-in NBC and logistic regression models in Python. 


## Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) 
Implement multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor or MLP classifier to solve a regression problem or a classification problem of your choosing. You may use any and all built-in methods.

## K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) 

Implement the k nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python or MATLAB to solve a classification problem for a dataset of your choosing with continuous input and categorical output.
